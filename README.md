# 🩺 APTOS Diabetic Retinopathy Screening
### EfficientNet-B2 + CBAM + GeM + Two-Phase Fine-Tuning

A deep learning pipeline for automatic grading of **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** from retinal fundus images using the **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection** dataset.

The project follows the **CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology and focuses on building a highly optimized yet lightweight medical image classification system capable of running on consumer-grade hardware.

# 🧠 Model Overview

The proposed model combines several modern deep learning techniques specifically designed for retinal image analysis.

- EfficientNet-B2 feature extractor
- CBAM attention mechanism
- GeM pooling layer
- Fully connected classifier with BatchNorm and Dropout

Training is performed using a carefully designed **Two-Phase Fine-Tuning Strategy** that maximizes transfer learning performance while preventing feature drift through strict BatchNorm statistics locking.

Complete implementation details are available in the **Modeling** directory.

---

# 📊 Evaluation

The final model achieves a **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.8806**, demonstrating strong agreement with expert annotations.

Performance was evaluated using:

- Quadratic Weighted Kappa (Primary Metric)
- Accuracy
- Macro Precision
- Macro Recall
- Macro F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

Detailed analysis and discussion are available in the **Evaluation** directory.
